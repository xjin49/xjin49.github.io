<h3>Position Summary:</h3>

The Department of Environmental Sciences at [Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey](https://www.rutgers.edu) is seeking a postdoctoral position to join Xiaomeng Jin’s group to study the impacts of wildfires on air quality. 

The successful candidate will work with [Prof. Xiaomeng Jin (Rutgers University)](https://xjin49.github.io) and [Prof. Ronald Cohen (University of California, Berkeley)](https://cohen.cchem.berkeley.edu) under NOAA Atmospheric Chemistry, Carbon Cycle and Climate ([AC4](https://cpo.noaa.gov/Meet-the-Divisions/Earth-System-Science-and-Modeling/AC4)) program. 
The position will involve using satellite observations, in-situ measurements and a hierarchy of models to study the impacts of wildfire emissions on the ozone-NOx-VOC chemistry over urban areas. 
The primary responsibilities include improving satellite retrievals of nitrogen dioxide and formaldehyde for fire plumes, using these satellite retrievals to track the evolution of ozone precursors from fires, 
and studying the synergistic effects of pyrogenic and anthropogenic emissions on ozone formation over urban areas. The candidate is expected to write and publish results in scientific journals, and present research outcomes at scientific conferences. 

The initial appointment is 1 year, with the possibility of extension depending on the candidate’s performance and funding availability. 

Our group is committed to creating an accessible, supportive and inclusive environment. Applications from diverse background and under-represented groups are strongly encouraged. 

<h3>Requirements:</h3>
The candidate must have a Ph.D. in a related field (e.g., Atmospheric Science, Earth Science, Environmental Science, Environmental Engineering, Remote Sensing) by the time of appointment. 

<h3>Desired Skills:</h3>
Background in atmospheric chemistry and/or remote sensing is strongly preferred. Experience with atmospheric models (e.g., GEOS-Chem, WRF-Chem) and remote sensing observations is desired. Skills in python, Fortran and high-performance computing are also desired.  

<h3>Application Procedure:</h3>
Complete applications, including a CV, a cover letter with research interests, and contact information of 3 references can be submitted through [Rutgers Jobs](https://jobs.rutgers.edu/postings/195946). The expected start date is June 2023 but is negotiable. Applications received by April 15 will be given priority. Please direct inquires to Xiaomeng Jin (xiaomeng.jin@rutgers.edu).
