<p>I am an assistant professor at the <a href="http://envsci.rutgers.edu" target="_blank"> Department of Environmental Sciences, Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey </a>. 
I worked as a NOAA Climate and Global Change Postdoc Fellow at the Department of Chemistry, University of California, Berkeley. 
I received my PhD in Earth and Environmental Sciences in 2020 from Columbia University. </p>

I study atmospheric chemistry. My research aims to advance our understanding of the <b>source, chemical formation, and impacts of air pollution </b>, 
especially surface ozone and fine particulate matter pollution, using remote sensing observations along with computer models and in-situ measurements.
